# Contributing to Autonomous Living Architecture

## Repository Purpose

This repository documents architectural patterns and design decisions for autonomous living systems. It serves as a reference architecture and educational resource rather than a collaborative development project.

## How to Contribute

### 🤔 **Architectural Questions & Discussions**

**Questions About Design Decisions:**
- Open issues with the `question` label
- Reference specific architectural patterns or ADRs
- Explain your context and what you're trying to understand

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Open issues with the `discussion` label  
- Share your architectural approach with rationale
- Explain trade-offs and lessons learned from your implementation

### 📝 **Documentation Improvements**

**Clarity & Corrections:**
- Open issues describing unclear explanations or technical errors
- Include file paths and specific sections
- Suggest concrete improvements when possible

**Additional Context:**
- Share implementation experiences with similar patterns
- Contribute lessons learned without revealing personal data
- Suggest architectural pattern improvements based on real-world usage

### 🚫 **Contribution Boundaries**

**What We Don't Accept:**
- Complete production-ready implementations
- Requests for specific configuration help ("how do I configure X for my setup")
- Basic tool tutorials (belongs in tool-specific documentation)
- Personal data or production secrets

## Documentation Standards

**Architectural Focus:**
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just implementation details
- Include alternatives considered and trade-offs made
- Focus on patterns and principles over specific configurations

**Consistency:**
- Follow existing documentation structure and terminology
- Maintain appropriate level of abstraction
- Use relative links for internal references

## Response Expectations

This is a personal architectural documentation project. Expect responses within 1-2 weeks, though often faster. Most contributions will be discussed in issues before any documentation changes.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be Respectful:** Critique ideas, not people. Assume good intent.
- **Be Constructive:** Provide specific suggestions and share your reasoning.
- **Be Patient:** Architectural discussions take time to develop properly.

Questions about contributing? Open an issue asking - better to clarify expectations than spend time on something that doesn't fit the repository's mission.
