# 🤖 Autonomous Living: Build Your Life as a System

**Ever wondered if you could run your life with the same rigor, efficiency, and scale as a Fortune 500 company? This repository shows you exactly how.**

This is an **Architectural Showcase** of a fully integrated, "Automation-First" ecosystem. It bridges the gap between simple hobbyist scripts and professional-grade software engineering. By exploring this project, you will not only see a blueprint for personal autonomy but also gain deep insights into how **enterprise open-source infrastructure** is designed, integrated, and monitored.

## 🎯 What You Can Gain From This Repo
If you are an engineer, architect, or automation enthusiast, this repository provides:
*   **The "Personal ERP" Blueprint:** A template for managing health, finance, productivity, and documentation as interconnected modules.
*   **Enterprise Experience:** Real-world implementations of Hub-and-Spoke patterns, Decoupled Architecture, and Observability-by-Design.
*   **Systems Thinking:** A practical lesson in how to eliminate the "decision tax" through formal Traceability and SOPs.

---

## 🏛️ Enterprise-Standard Infrastructure
While personal in scale, the architecture follows the same standards used in modern corporate platforms:
*   **Multi-Layer Decoupling:** Separation of concerns between Interface, Intelligence, Domain, and Data layers.
*   **Observability-by-Design:** Full-stack monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) treating life metrics as Business KPIs.
*   **Data Performance:** PostgreSQL table partitioning designed for 10+ years of high-speed data integrity.
*   **Formal Governance:** Every automation is justified by an outcome in a formal Traceability Matrix.

## 🔍 What You Will (and Won't) Find

### ✅ What is IN here:
*   **High-Level & Low-Level Designs:** The conceptual and technical "Truth" of the system.
*   **Sanitized Automation Specs:** Documentation for n8n workflows, Python directors, and AI agents.
*   **Database Schemas:** Enterprise-ready PostgreSQL DDLs for finance, pantry, and health.
*   **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** The "Human-in-the-loop" instructions for system maintenance.
*   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** The professional history of *why* technology choices were made.

### ❌ What is NOT here:
*   **Turnkey "One-Click" Installers:** This is a showcase of *architecture*, not a commercial app.
*   **Personal Data:** All metrics, schedules, and specific secrets have been scrubbed by our custom sanitization engine.
*   **Enterprise-only overhead:** Features like multi-user RBAC or massive HA clusters are excluded to keep the local homelab lean and efficient.

## 🗺️ How to Navigate
Follow the path of an architect:
1.  **[High-Level Design](docs/20_SYSTEMS/High-Level-Design.md):** Start here to understand the 5-layer model.
2.  **[Cross-System Integration](docs/20_SYSTEMS/Cross-System-Integration.md):** See how the Hub-and-Spoke pattern prevents "spaghetti integration."
3.  **[Goal Documentation Standard](docs/10_GOALS/DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md):** Learn how we maintain technical rigor across 12 domains.
4.  **[Automation Specs](docs/50_AUTOMATIONS/):** Deep-dive into the actual logic.

## ☕ Fuel the Architecture
Building and maintaining this level of technical rigor is a labor of love and a massive time investment. If this architectural blueprint provides you with an "Aha!" moment, saves you hours of trial and error, or helps you structure your own systems engineering journey, I would be incredibly grateful for your support.
