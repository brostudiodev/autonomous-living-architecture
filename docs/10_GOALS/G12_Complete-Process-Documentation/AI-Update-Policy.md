# AI Update Policy

## Allowed
- Propose changes via PR
- Add missing sections to docs
- Update links, indexes, and navigation
- Suggest refactors that reduce duplication

## Not allowed (without explicit human approval)
- Anything touching secrets/credentials
- Financial transactions or automation that can move money
- Security policy changes
- Deleting large sections of docs

## Safety rails
- Every AI-generated change must reference the exact file(s) it modified
- Prefer small PRs
- Add test/verification steps when touching automations
