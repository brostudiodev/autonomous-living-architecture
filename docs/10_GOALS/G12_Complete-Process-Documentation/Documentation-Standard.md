# Documentation Standard

## Why
Documentation is not a diary. It's an operational artifact that must survive time, fatigue, and AI edits.

## Required sections (for most docs)
- Purpose
- Scope / non-scope
- Inputs / outputs
- Dependencies
- Procedure (checklist)
- Failure modes
- Security notes
- Owner + review cadence

## File naming
- Goals: `G##_`
- Systems: `S##_`
- Workflows: `WF###__`
- ADRs: `ADR-####`
