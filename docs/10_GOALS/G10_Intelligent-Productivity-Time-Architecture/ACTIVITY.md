## Q1 2026 Progress

### 2026-02-20 | Production System Deployment (The "Master Brain" Update)

**Action:** Implemented MINS Engine and Dynamic Adaptive Scheduling in `autonomous_daily_manager.py`.

**What:** 
- Added `get_roadmap_mins()` to automatically pull Q1 tasks from all 12 goals.
- Refined `generate_schedule()` to swap blocks based on real-time health and finance data.
- Optimized task injection to handle budget alerts and pantry low-stock items.

**Why:** To eliminate "decision tax" during morning planning and ensure focus is data-driven.

**Result:** 
- Daily notes now pre-filled with high-impact "MINS" from roadmaps.
- Schedule automatically prioritizes recovery or urgent financial admin.
- Q1 Goal Completion moved to **90%** for G10 core infrastructure.

---

## Q1 Progress Status: **90% Complete** ✅

### Remaining Q1 Tasks:
- [ ] Create productivity dashboard in S01 Observability with key metrics (focus time, completion rate).
- [ ] Finalize integration with G12 Meta-System for weekly automated retrospectives.
