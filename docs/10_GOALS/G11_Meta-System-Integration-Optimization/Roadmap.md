# Roadmap (2026)

## Q1 (Jan–Mar)
- [ ] Define Meta-System architecture and core data integration patterns (Documented in Architecture-and-Integration.md)
- [ ] Conduct a detailed review of `docs/20_SYSTEMS/S04_Digital-Twin/` and `docs/20_SYSTEMS/S08_Automation-Orchestrator/` to understand their current design and intended integration points.
- [ ] Systematically map inputs and outputs for all goals (G01-G11), identifying which integration pattern each data flow follows.
- [ ] Begin defining a high-level unified data schema for S03 Data Layer that can accommodate data from diverse goals.
- [ ] Prototype a basic Meta-System dashboard in S01 (Observability) to display aggregated KPIs from at least two integrated goals.
- [ ] Document identified correlations and dependencies between the goals to inform future optimization strategies.

## Q2 (Apr–Jun)
- [ ] Expand data ingestion to include G06, G07, G08, G09, G10, G11
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics for identifying hidden patterns and relationships across goals
- [ ] Develop a rules engine for automated cross-goal optimization suggestions
- [ ] Create a "personal operating system" interface for holistic interaction
- [ ] Integrate predictive models from individual goals into a unified forecast

## Q3 (Jul–Sep)
- [ ] Implement AI-driven autonomous decision-making across integrated systems
- [ ] Develop dynamic feedback loops for continuous self-optimization of the entire ecosystem
- [ ] Create advanced scenario planning and simulation capabilities
- [ ] Establish robust ethical AI guidelines and privacy controls for the Meta-System
- [ ] Integrate with G04 (Digital Twin) for real-time visualization of holistic state

## Q4 (Oct–Dec)
- [ ] Achieve a fully integrated, autonomous, and self-optimizing "Autonomous Living" Meta-System
- [ ] Document lessons learned and strategy for 2027 system evolution
- [ ] Finalize the "Personal OS" experience with intuitive controls and intelligent assistants
- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive security and resilience audit of the entire integrated ecosystem

## Dependencies
- **Systems:** S01 (Observability), S03 (Data Layer), S04 (Digital Twin), S08 (Automation Orchestrator)
- **External:** All other goals (G01-G11) for data sources and functional components.
- **Other goals:** G09 (Complete Process Documentation) for documenting Meta-System architecture and processes. All other goals are feeders/consumers of G12.
