# G11 Meta-System Integration - Execution State

## Current Context
**Phase:** Planning (Integration Architecture)
**Milestone:** Cross-system integration framework by May 31
**Strategic Context:** Orchestration layer ensuring all automation systems work together

---

## 🟢 NEXT (Ready When Core Systems Operational)

- [ ] **Map all system integration points** `G11-T01` `90m` `@planning` `#p2`
  - Inventory all automation systems across goals
  - Document current integration points and data flows
  - Identify integration gaps and optimization opportunities
  - Design unified integration architecture

---

## 🔵 READY (Dependencies Met, Available)

- [ ] **Design system health monitoring** `G11-T02` `90m` `depends:G11-T01` `@deep-work` `#p2`
  - Define health check metrics for all systems
  - Plan centralized monitoring architecture (Grafana/Prometheus)
  - Design alert system for system failures
  - Create unified system health dashboard

- [ ] **Build integration testing framework** `G11-T03` `120m` `depends:G11-T01` `@implementation` `#p2`
  - Create automated integration test suite
  - Implement continuous monitoring workflows
  - Build failure detection and notification system
  - Design self-healing mechanisms where possible

- [ ] **Design optimization feedback loops** `G11-T04` `90m` `depends:G11-T02` `@deep-work` `#p2`
  - Define optimization metrics across all systems
  - Create learning algorithms for continuous improvement
  - Plan A/B testing framework for system changes
  - Design automated optimization recommendations

---

## ⚪ BLOCKED (Waiting on Dependencies)

- [ ] **Implement cross-system orchestration** `G11-T05` `120m` `depends:G11-T03` `@implementation` `#p3`
- [ ] **Build predictive system optimization** `G11-T06` `120m` `depends:G11-T04` `@deep-work` `#p3`

---

## ✅ DONE (Recently Completed)

- [x] **Define meta-system integration scope** `G11-T00` `45m` `@planning` `#p2` ✓2025-01-06 ⏱️45m
  - Established integration vision and principles
  - Identified key system dependencies and interaction points
  - Planned phased optimization approach

---

## Intelligence Notes
- **Strategic Timing:** Build after individual systems proven and operational (Q3-Q4)
- **Highest Complexity:** This is the "system of systems" - requires mature foundation
- **Enterprise Value:** Meta-system orchestration = premium consulting capability
- **Integration Focus:** Prevents automation ecosystem from becoming fragmented
- **Evening Work:** Architecture and orchestration design fits deep-work sessions
- **Recommendation:** Defer until G04, G05, G08, G10 foundations are solid
