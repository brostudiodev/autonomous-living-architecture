## Q2 (Apr–Jun)
- [ ] Document all existing critical systems (S00-S10) according to GDS
- [ ] Document all existing production automations (n8n, scripts, HA)
- [ ] Develop a system for auto-generating cross-references and links within documentation
- [ ] Implement a periodic review process for documentation accuracy and currency
- [ ] Explore LLM-assisted documentation generation for routine tasks

## Q3 (Jul–Sep)
- [ ] Create interactive architectural diagrams linked to documentation
- [ ] Develop a search and knowledge retrieval system for all documentation
- [ ] Establish a change management process for documentation updates
- [ ] Automate documentation deployment to a dedicated knowledge base (e.g., static site generator)
- [ ] Integrate G09 insights into G12 (Meta-System) for knowledge accessibility

## Q4 (Oct–Dec)
- [ ] Achieve comprehensive and current documentation for all autonomous living systems
- [ ] Document lessons learned and strategy for 2027 documentation maintenance

## Dependencies
- **Systems:** S08 (Automation Orchestrator for publishing workflows), G12 (Meta-System for integration tracking)
- **External:** LLM APIs (for documentation assistance), static site generators (e.g., MkDocs)
- **Other goals:** All other goals depend on G09 for clear, consistent, and current documentation.
