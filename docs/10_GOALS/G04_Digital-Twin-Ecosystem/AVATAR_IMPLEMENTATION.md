   - Eye contact: Stare directly into lens
   - Natural pauses: Brief pauses between sentences
   - Head movement: Subtle nods during key points
   - Hand gestures: Keep subtle, within frame if visible
   - Body language: Confident, relaxed posture

2. **Technical Settings**:
   - Format: MP4 or MOV
   - Audio: External microphone if possible
   - Multiple takes: Record 3-5 versions
   - Duration: 5-10 minutes total
   - Quality check: Review immediately for issues

3. **Environment**:
   - Quiet room with no background noise
   - Consistent lighting throughout recording
   - Phone on silent mode to avoid interruptions
