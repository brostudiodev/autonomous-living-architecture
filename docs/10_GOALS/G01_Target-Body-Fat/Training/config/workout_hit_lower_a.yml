# Lower: keep it brutally simple but not stupid (quad + hinge + calf + trunk)
exercise_order:
  - ex_leg_press                    # main quad-dominant
  - ex_leg_curl_machine             # hamstrings
  - ex_back_extension               # hinge/posterior chain (swap for RDL if you prefer)
  - ex_calf_raise_machine           # calves
  - ex_ab_crunch_machine            # trunk (optional but easy to track)

notes:
  - "All loads are logged in kg. Tempo is ignored; only TUT seconds matter."
  - "TUT>90s is a strong signal load may be too light IF form_ok=true AND max_effort=true."
  - "I decide case-by-case whether to increase. If knees/back feel off, hold weight and keep form strict."
  - "If I only do one exercise (e.g., just leg press), I still log the session; skipped exercises are simply not logged in sets.csv."
