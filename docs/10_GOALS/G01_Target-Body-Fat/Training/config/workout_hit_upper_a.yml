notes:
  - "All loads are logged in kg. Tempo is ignored; only TUT seconds matter."
  - "TUT>90s is a strong signal load may be too light IF form_ok=true AND max_effort=true."
  - "I decide case-by-case whether to increase. If recovery/mood is low, hold weight and log max_effort=false if needed."
  - "If shoulder/elbow discomfort appears, prioritize form_ok and pain-free range over progression."
