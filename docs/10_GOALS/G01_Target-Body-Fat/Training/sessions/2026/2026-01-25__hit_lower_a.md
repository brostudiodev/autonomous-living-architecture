## What was different today?
- I did not have strenghts to do full body so I decided to take legs to the max.
- I do extra sets: squat, straight-legged deadift, machine, squat at time to failure, calves, then once more squats to failure.
- Logged in sets.csv: leg press + … (lower split) see sets.csv rows for 2026-01-20”

## What might be the cause?
- Recovery: not fully recovered (felt it pre-workout).
- Mood: OK, but high work load / mental focus needed for work.
- Pain/injury: none.
- Sleep: normal.

## Decision for next time (explicit)
- Increase: only exercises where `tut_s > 90` AND `max_effort=true` AND `form_ok=true`.
- Hold: everything else.
- Reduce: none (unless form breaks next time).
