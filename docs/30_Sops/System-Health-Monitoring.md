# SOP: System Health Monitoring

## Purpose
Standardize the process of verifying system-wide data flow and connectivity.

## Procedure
1. Open the G11 System Connectivity Map.
2. Check for ❌ icons in Infrastructure Status.
3. Verify "Last Activity" in databases is within expected range (e.g., < 48h).
4. For "Orphan Goals" (no data flow), assess if integration is possible or documentation-only is sufficient.
