# ADR-0001: Repo Structure

## Context
We need one repo that is readable for humans, maintainable by future-you, and suitable for AI-assisted updates.

## Decision
Use a docs-first structure:
- Goals
- Systems
- SOPs
- Runbooks
- Automations
- ADRs

## Consequences
- Predictable locations enable automation and indexing
- Requires discipline: no random dumping of files
