# North Star (Automation-First Living)

## Definition
By end of 2026, ordinary life operations run with minimal manual work, backed by:
- **Automation** (workflows, scripts, orchestrations)
- **Observability** (metrics/logs/traces, alerts)
- **Recoverability** (backups, rollback, runbooks)
- **Security** (identity, least privilege, audit trail)

## Outcomes (non-hand-wavy)
- Time reclaimed weekly (tracked)
- Reduced manual decisions for repeatable tasks
- Lower error rate in finance/admin tasks
- Predictable routines (health, training, learning)

## Constraints
- Privacy first (especially health + finance)
- “Automation that can’t be monitored is just a future outage”
- If a system can’t be restored, it doesn’t exist
