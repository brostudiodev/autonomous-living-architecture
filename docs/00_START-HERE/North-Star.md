# North Star: Automation-First Living

## The 2026 Vision
By the end of 2026, **everything** I do on a daily basis will be **automated**, so that I don’t have to focus on ordinary tasks and everything can run without me. 

The goal is to move from "Automation" to true **Autonomy** across all aspects of life, allowing me to focus 100% on high-value work, creativity, and strategic growth.

## Core Domains for Autonomy
I am engineering systems to handle the following domains without manual intervention:
- **Wealth:** Finances, expense tracking, and savings optimization.
- **Environment:** Smart home management and 24/7 monitoring.
- **Logistics:** Shopping, grocery procurement, and household supplies.
- **Nutrition:** Food planning, cooking management, and inventory.
- **Career:** Professional management (hours tracking, job searching, and career intelligence).
- **Physicality:** Health monitoring, biometric tracking, and workout orchestration.
- **Transport:** Car maintenance, inspections, and expense management.
- **Infrastructure:** A self-healing homelab that diagnoses and repairs itself.

## Strategic Positioning
Beyond personal efficiency, this ecosystem serves as the ultimate proof-of-concept for my professional mission:
> **"Position myself as a specialist in AI and automation for enterprise-level companies."**

## Automationbro
This project is the technical foundation for the **Automationbro** brand. While several use cases are already live, the 2026 roadmap reflects a total shift: **ALL aspects of life (besides the specific execution of professional deep work) must become autonomous.**

## Constraints
- **Privacy First:** Especially regarding health and financial data.
- **Monitoring is Mandatory:** "Automation that can’t be monitored is just a future outage."
- **Total Recoverability:** If a system can’t be restored autonomously, it doesn’t exist.
