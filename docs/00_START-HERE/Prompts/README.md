# Prompts

This folder contains copy/paste prompts for generating documentation that matches the repo’s canonical structure.

## Available prompts
- [LLM Documentation Generator](LLM-Documentation-Generator.md) (also outputs a `Systems.md.patch` snippet to update the goal traceability table)

## Rules
- Goals must always be referenced as `goal-gXX` (e.g. `goal-g01`).
- Generated docs must follow: `docs/10_GOALS/DOCUMENTATION-STANDARD.md`.
