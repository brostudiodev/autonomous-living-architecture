# Principles

## Automation principles
1. Automate the *boring* first.
2. Automate only what you can observe.
3. Prefer simple + reliable over clever + fragile.
4. Every automation must have a manual fallback (until proven stable).

## Documentation principles
- Write for future-you on low sleep.
- If a procedure can’t be followed, it’s not documented.
- Prefer checklists over paragraphs.
